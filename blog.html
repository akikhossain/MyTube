            1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
          </h1>
          <p class="mb-3">
            In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared using var, let, and
            const differs, and understanding these scopes is essential for
            writing reliable and maintainable code. Here's a discussion of the
            scope of each:
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">Var Scope:</h2>
          <p>
            var variables are function-scoped, or globally scoped if declared
            outside of any function. They are hoisted to the top of their
            containing function or global scope. Variables declared with var are
            hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-4">
          <div>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">let and const Scope:</h2>
            <p>
              let and const declarations are block-scoped, which means their
              scope is limited to the nearest enclosing block (usually denoted
              by curly braces {}). This includes loops, conditionals, and
              functions.Unlike var, let and const are not hoisted to the top of
              their containing block. This makes the code behavior more
              predictable and less prone to unexpected issues. They are not
              hoisted to the top of their containing block, reducing unexpected
              behavior.

            2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
          </h1>
          <p class="mb-3">
            In JavaScript, both null and undefined are used to represent the
            absence of a value or the lack of a meaningful value, but they are
            used in slightly different contexts and have distinct use cases:
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">Undefined:</h2>
          <p>
            undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not
            been assigned a value or a function that doesn't return anything
            explicitly. It is often used as the default initial value for
            function parameters. undefined is also the default value of object
            properties that have not been defined.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-2 mb-2">Use Cases:</h3>
          <p>When a variable has been declared but not yet assigned.</p>
          <p>
            As a default parameter value to handle missing or undefined function
            arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the initial value for variables that will later hold specific
            values.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4 mb-8">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">Null:</h2>
          <p>
            Null represents the intentional absence of any object value or a
            deliberate assignment of "no value." It is often used to indicate
            that a variable or object property should have no value or should be
            reset. null is explicitly assigned by the programmer to signify the
            absence of a meaningful value.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-2 mb-2">Use Cases:</h3>
          <p>
            To explicitly set a variable or object property to indicate no value
            or reset it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a return value for functions that need to indicate the absence of
            a meaningful result.

            3. What do you mean by REST API?
          </h1>
          <p class="mb-3">
            REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer
            Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural
            principles and constraints used for designing networked applications
            and services. It's a style of building web services that are
            scalable, stateless, and easy to consume. REST is not a technology
            itself but a set of constraints and guidelines for designing web
            services. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development,
            especially for building web services and APIs that enable
            communication between different systems and devices over the
            internet. They are known for their simplicity, scalability, and ease
            of use, making them a popular choice for many applications and
            services.
